# TestTheDocs Vale Styles

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/testthedocs/vale-styles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/testthedocs/vale-styles)

This repository contains pre-written checks for Vale based on popular style guides.

We took them from those created in the [Vale project](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/) that are in the process of being removed,
and we wanted to create a new home for them for people to learn how to use this flexible tool.
